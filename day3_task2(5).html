I also used to watch repeatedly some movies because of <b><mark><u>dialogues consisting very meaningful in a rhyming manner</u></mark></b>. <br>
Those kind of dialogues written by <b><u>Trivikram Srinivas</u></b>, also famously known as <b><u>Guruji</u></b>. <br>
He is said to be <mark><i><b>a magician for the meaningful dialogues and generating fun, drama, emotion</b></i></mark> feels like getting connected to the movie automatically.<br>
<b><u>Trivikram Srinivas</u></b>, oftenly made a mark for his <i><u>unique writing style</u></i> in <b>TFI(Telugu Film Industry)</b>. <br>
<b>Trivikram’s films</b> are known for their <mark><b>clever humor</b></mark>, which is <mark><i>woven seamlessly into the narrative</i></mark>. His dialogues often contain <mark>witty wordplay and situational comedy</mark> that appeal to a wide audience.<br>
Many of his films revolve around <mark><b><u>family dynamics</u></b></mark>, often focusing on <mark><b><u>broken families</u></b></mark>. This recurring theme resonates with audiences, as <mark><i>it explores the complexities of familial relationships</i></mark>.<br>
<b><mark>Trivikram’s</mark></b> scripts often include <b><u>multiple subplots</u></b> that develop alongside the main story. This adds depth to his films and keeps the audience engaged with various <b><u>character arcs and mini-stories</u></b>.<br>
His dialogues are not only <mark><b><u>humorous</u></b></mark> but also <mark><b><u>thought-provoking and emotionally impactful</u></b></mark>. </pre>
