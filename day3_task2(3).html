In recent days, I also became an admirer of <mark><u>Hanu-Man</u></mark> movie director <b><u>Prashanth Varma</u></b>.<br>
At some unexpected time in 2019, I saw the film called <mark><u>Awe</u></mark> which was his debue movie and watched it without knowing anything about it.<br>
It is said to be a <b><i><u>unique attempt</u></i></b> as this movie explored and dealt with some <mark><u>sensitive themes like child abuse, homo sexual etc.</u></mark> which made viewers <mark>realizing and thought-provoking</mark>. <br>
This film made me to <mark><b><u>show some kind of respect towards director and his vision</u></b></mark>.<br>
After four to five years, Director showcased one more visual wonder and mythological super hero movie called <mark><u>Hanu-Man</u></mark>.<br> 
I strongly believe and having devotion on <mark><b><u>Lord Hanuman</u></b></mark>. So, <mark>what do the movie gonna show about Lord Hanuman</mark> and <mark>how the movie was presented to audience</mark> with these doubts I went to theater. <br>
But trust me that it might not be a unique film but director <mark><b><u>incorporated the Lord Hanuman references</u></b></mark> and <i><u>blended superhero concept brilliantly</u></i> with his budget constraints of <mark><i>20 to 25 crores</i></mark>.<br>
<mark><b><u>Lord Hanuman</u></b></mark> related scenes are said to be <mark><u>soul of the film</u></mark> and that climax five minutes changed the entire movie in an whole another level made all excited.<br>
Eventhough, I felt like theater became <mark><i>hindu temple</i></mark> suddenly.<br>
With this <mark><u>Hanu-Man</u></mark> movie, my respect increased towards <b><u>Director Prashanth Varma and his vision</u></b> made excited to wait for second part of Hanu-Man movie.<br>
After watching and knowing about director's films, he made a mark of <b><i><u>creative and unique filmmaker</u></i></b>.
