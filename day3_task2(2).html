The main reason for become an admirer of the director named <mark><b>Phanindra Narsetti</b></mark> is his directorial debut independent film name <Mark><b><u>Madhuram</u></b></mark> watched without knowing anything. <br>
This movie look like explaining <mark><b><i>seven stages of love</i></b></mark> by incorporating <u><b>some mythological points, some old movie references, poetic dialogues etc.</b></u> to showcase the importance towards that film. <br>
The director had my respect as explaining <u><b>seven stages of love with twists, connecting dots till end, the dialogues which will be relatable and poetic</b></u> made us connected with this movie till end.<br>
It also made me <b>thought-provoking</b> about the <mark><u><i>love definition and stages explanation with real life examples</i></u></mark> happened previously.<br>
This director also made a feature film of <mark><b><u>Manu</u></b></mark> which is said to be complicated story but very <mark><b>artistic film look like very poetic</b></mark>.<br>
With these films, director made a special mark on <mark><b>poetic dialogues will make viewers either thought-provoking or connected</b></mark>.
