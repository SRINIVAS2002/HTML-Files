From my childhood days, I used to watch <b>Super Star Mahesh Babu</b> movies many more times which will not get bored.<br> 
Even though <mark><i><b>I am a fan of Stylish Star Allu Arjun</b></i></mark>, I liked movies of <b>Mahesh Babu</b> a lot.<br> 
He absolutely look <u>handsome and his charismatic <del>smile</del> style</u> made fans go crazy.
<br>He has adopted two villages, one is <b><u>Burripalem in Andhra Pradesh</u></b> and another one is <b><u>Siddhapuram in Telangana</u></b>, and involved in their <b><mark><i>development, focusing on improving infrastructure, healthcare, and education</i></mark></b>.<br>
He has also been associated with the <b><u>Heal-a-Child Foundation</u></b>, which <b><u><mark>helps children from underprivileged backgrounds receive medical treatment</mark></u></b>.<br>
There have been numerous accounts from fans and colleagues about his <mark><b>humble and down-to-earth nature</b></mark>. <br>
For instance, during the <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic, he contributed significantly to relief efforts and supported daily wage workers in the <b><mark>TFI(Telugu Film Industry)</mark></b>.<br>
These below real life examples are the proof of that <b>Mahesh Babu</b> is a <mark><b>Kind hearted gentleman</b></mark>.</pre>
