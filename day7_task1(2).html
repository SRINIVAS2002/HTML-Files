        Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame. <br>
        In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh-directed action-thriller Pokiri. <br>
        The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time, and according to Vogue India, cemented Babu's reputation as a "superstar". <br>
        In 2011, he starred in Dookudu, which became the first Telugu film to gross over â‚¹1 billion. <br>
        Businessman (2012), his next film, was well received and became one of the year's highest grossing Telugu films at a time that was particularly harsh on other big-budget productions. <br>
        The following year, Babu co-starred alongside Venkatesh in the critically and commercially acclaimed drama film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, which was considered the first Telugu multi-starrer in decades. <br>
        He then featured in Sukumar's 2014 psychological thriller film 1: Nenokkadine. <br>
        Although Babu's performance as a schizophrenic rock star was lauded by critics, the film itself received mixed reviews.</p>
